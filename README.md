# GradientDescent

Minimization problems refer in the simplest cases to find the minimum argument of a function. 
You just need to run the GradientDescent.m file in order to see the results. You'll find the algorithm of gradient descent for the following cases : 
1) Least mean squares
2) Tikhonov Regularization for 1D model
3) TIkhonov Regularization for 2D model
